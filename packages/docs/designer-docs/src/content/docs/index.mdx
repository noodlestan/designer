        This suite provides a collection of tools to enhance design system automation
        workflows.

        You can use it to capture, track, and visualize context-aware decision decisions,
        integrate data from other systems, and generate code artifacts and beautiful documentation.

ðŸ’¡ Ideas

-   Load decisions from YAML, TypeScript
-   Import from Figma, Specify, TokenStudio, ...
-   Generate snapshots, and track version history.
-   Studio App: web-based tool for interactive navigation, collaboration,
    and navigation of design decisions.
-   API-Driven: Interact with decisions programmatically for integration and automation.
-   Version Control & Review: Built-in workflows for tracking changes,
    reviewing, and reverting decisions.
