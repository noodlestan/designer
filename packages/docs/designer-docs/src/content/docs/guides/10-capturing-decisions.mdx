## Express decisions in JSON

At a minimum, a decision record requires

-   `model` - defines both the decision type and which model to use to produce it
-   `name` - to identify the decision
-   `params` - an object following the decision model schema

The following example defines two decisions:

-   a [color-value](/decision-models/color-value) decision, via the
    [color-value/explicit](/decision-models/color-value/explicit) model

-   a [color-set](/decision-models/color-set) decision, via the
    [color-set/modifier](/decision-models/color-set/modifier) model

```json
[
    {
        "type": "color-value/explicit",
        "name": "Primary Background",
        "params": {
            "value": "#090E0B"
        }
    },
    {
        "type": "color-set/modifier",
        "name": "Primary Backgrounds",
        "params": {
            "start": { "$name": "Primary Background" },
            "modifier": { "lightness": 3 },
            "steps": 5
        }
    }
]
```

If you are declaring decisions in JSON files you are encouraged to organize them in small groups
using directories and files.

<FileTree>

-   space/
-   typography/
-   colors/
    -   base.json
    -   palettes.json
    -   ratios.json
-   contexts/

</FileTree>

decision files at once and validate them.
