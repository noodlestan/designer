## Express decisions in JSON

At a minimum, a decision record requires

-   a `type` - the decision model, the schema
-   a `name` - to identify the decision
-   and one or more `params` as defined by the chose decision model

The following example defines a pair of decisions:

-   [ColorValueDecisions](/decisions/color-value)
-   [ColorScaleDecision`](/decisions/color-scalue)

```json
[
    {
        "type": "color-value/explicit",
        "name": "Green Foreground",
        "params": {
            "value": "#090E0B"
        }
    },
    {
        "type": "color-scale/modifier",
        "name": "Green Foregrounds",
        "params": {
            "start": { "ref": "Green Foreground" },
            "modifier": { "hue": 0 },
            "steps": 5
        }
    }
]
```

If you are declaring decisions in JSON files you are encouraged to organize them in small groups
using directories and files.

<FileTree>

-   space/
-   typography/
-   colors/
    -   base.json
    -   palettes.json
    -   ratios.json
-   contexts/

</FileTree>

See [Guides / Validating Decisions](/guides/20-validating-design-decisions-with-schemas)
to learn how to quickly load decisions from the filesystem.

### Schema

#### à¼¶ `type`: `<decision-type / model>`

The decision _shape_ is determined by both the input params and the output of the decision.

-   All decisions of type `color-scale/*` produces a `ColorScaleDecision` which exposes
    the resolved color values, individual color components, scale and color transformations,
    and - when declared - tokens and token references.

-   The specific `color-scale/modifier` decision model determines how the color scale is generated.
    In this case, the color gradient starts at the `start` color and successively applies
    the HSL `modifier` to the previous value, producing a total of 5 `steps`.

See [Reference: Decision types](/decision-types) for a comprehensive list of decision models
and the schema for their input parameters.

#### à¼¶ `name: string` (non unique)

Design decision name is mandatory.

```json
   "name": "Green Foreground"
```

**Note:** The same decision name can be declared more than once, as long as the decision is scoped
to different `contexts` each time.

The decision name can be used to create relationships between decisions.

```json
    "params": {
        "start": { "ref": "Green Foreground" }
    }

```

#### à¼¶ `id: string` (optional) (unique)

When provided it can also be used to retrieve decision values and to create relationships
between decisions.

```json
   "id": "green-foreground-base"
```

By referencing the record's unique `id`, instead of the decision `name`, you can link
a decision to a specific record regardless of applicable context.

```json
    "params": {
        "start": { "ref": "#green-foreground-base" }
    }
```

#### à¼¶ `description: string` (optional)

Provide a small description for the decision.

```json
    "decription": "Strongest shade of Green"
```

#### à¼¶ `usage: object` (optional)

Otherwise know an _Application_, these guidelines inform the intent of these decisions,
namely to _what_ they should be applied.

```json
    "usage": {
      "intendedFor": ["Icons", "Backgrounds"],
      "notFor": ["Typography"]
    }
```

#### à¼¶ `context: string[] | {all: string[], some?: string[]} ` (optional)

Contexts inform _where_, _when_ or _to whom_ a certain design decision is applicable.

The decision value will exist only when at least one of these contexts is present.

```json
    "contexts": ["Email", "Support"]
```

Alternatively, a list of required contexts can be provided via an object:

-   `all: string[]` - The decision will only be in effect when all these contexts are present.

```json
    "contexts": {
      "all": ["Email", "Support"]
    }
```

-   `some?: string[]` - When provided, at least one of these contexts must also be present.

```json
    "contexts": {
      "all": ["Email", "Support"],
      "some": ["Headers", "Footers"]
    }
```

#### à¼¶ `params: object` (optional)

The parameters of each each decision are driven by the decision model.

As an example, the [color-scale/modifier](/decision-types/color-scale/modifier) decision model
requires as input:

-   a starting color (here provided as a reference to another decision)
-   a modifier object with `SignedPercentage` values for
    -   `h` - Hue
    -   `s` - Saturation
    -   `l` - Lightness
-   a number that specifies the total number of steps of the scale

```json
    "type": "color-scale/modifier"
    "params": {
        "start": { "ref": "Green Foreground" },
        "modifier": { "l": 5 },
        "steps": 5
    }
```

In turn, the [color-value/explicit](/decision-types/color-value/explicit) decision model,
requires only a single color as input.

```json
    "type": "color-value/explicit",
    "params": {
        "value": "#090E0B"
    }
```

The color value can be specified in a number of formats, according to the ðŸš§ schema.

```json
    "type": "color-value/explicit",
    "params": {
        "value": { "h": 144, "s": 0.22, "l": 0.05 }
    }
```

As well as a decision/token reference.

```json
    "type": "color-value/explicit",
    "params": {
        "value": { "ref": "Green Foreground" }
    }
```

See [Reference / Decision types](/decision-types) for details on each specific model.

#### à¼¶ `tokenize: object` (optional)

Declare tokens generated from this decision.
