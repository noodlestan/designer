## Open and extensible

Open and extensible by design, this system tries to be as un-opinionated as possible
about workflow and use cases

Whether you are capturing your decisions directly in JSON files or importing them
from other systems, `designer-decisions` provides a set of schema-based tools for
systematizing, validating, transforming, and visualizing decisions.

It is meant to enrich your workflow and use-cases and play well with others,
as opposed to dictating

## Key Concepts

    <Card title="Schema Based">ðŸš§</Card>
    <Card title="Decision">ðŸš§</Card>
    <Card title="Context">ðŸš§</Card>
    <Card title="Records">ðŸš§</Card>
    <Card title="Values">ðŸš§</Card>
    <Card title="Tokens">ðŸš§</Card>
    <Card title="Vizualizations">ðŸš§</Card>
</CardGrid>
