## Creating decision records

At a minimum, a decision record requires

-   `model` - defines both the decision type and which model should be used to produce it;
-   `name` - to identify the decision;
-   `params` - an object following the decision model schema.

The following example defines two decisions:

-   a [color-value](/models/decision-types/color-value) decision and a
    [color-set](/models/decision-types/color-set), both based on explicit values.

```json
[
    {
        "model": "color-value/explicit",
        "name": "Primary Background",
        "params": {
            "value": "#090E0B"
        }
    },
    {
        "model": "color-set/explicit",
        "name": "Brand Color",
        "params": {
            "values": ["#FF0000", "#00FF00", "#0000FF"]
        }
    }
]
```

If you are declaring decisions in JSON files you are encouraged to organize them in small groups
using directories and files.

<FileTree>

-   space/
-   typography/
-   colors/
    -   base.json
    -   palettes.json
    -   ratios.json
-   contexts/

</FileTree>

## Referencing decisions

You can reuse decision values and avoid repetition by referencing them in other decisions.

The following example defines an explicit [space-value](/models/decision-types/space-value)
decision called "Space Unit" and a [space-scale](/models/decision-types/space-scale#anchored) anchored
on the value of the first one.

```json
[
    {
        "type": "space-value/explicit",
        "name": "Space Unit",
        "params": {
            "value": "8"
        }
    },
    {
        "type": "space-scale/anchored",
        "name": "Sizing Scale",
        "params": {
            "anchor": { "$name": "Space Unit" },
            "after": {
                "steps": 5,
                "modifier": { "mode": "gemetric", "by": 1.5 }
            }
        }
    }
]
```

You can also reference items of a decision set set or scale by adding the index to the reference.

In the following example we are creating a [space-value](/models/decision-types/space-value) decision
based on the second element of the "Sizing Scale" declared before.

```json
[
    {
        "type": "space-value/explicit",
        "name": "Default Size",
        "params": {
            "value": { "$name": "Sizing Scale", "index": 3 }
        }
    }
]
```

Proceed to the next guide for step by step instructions on how to load all
decision files at once, as well as how to validate the input data and inspect
validation errors.
