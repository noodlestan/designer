## Creating decision records

At a minimum, a decision record requires

-   `model` - defines both the decision type and which model should be used to produce it;
-   `name` - to identify the decision;
-   `params` - an object following the decision model schema.

The following example defines two decisions:

-   a [Color Value](/models/decision-types/color-value) decision and a [Color Set](/models/decision-types/color-set), both based on explicit values.

```json
[
    {
        "model": "color-value/explicit",
        "name": "Primary Background",
        "params": {
            "value": "#090E0B"
        }
    },
    {
        "model": "color-set/explicit",
        "name": "Brand Colors",
        "params": {
            "values": ["#FF0000", "#00FF00", "#0000FF"]
        }
    }
]
```

<Aside type="tip">
    In the [Models / Decision Types](/models/decision-types) reference you will find sample data for
    each of the built-in decision models.
</Aside>

You are also free to create sub-directories and name the files as you wish.

When declaring decisions in JSON files you are encouraged to organize them in small files. Grouping decisions by type or scope is a good starting point.

<FileTree>
- space/
- typography/
- colors/
  - base.json
  - palettes.json
  - ratios.json
- contexts/

</FileTree>

## Referencing decisions

You can reuse decision values and avoid repetition by referencing them in other decisions.

The following example defines an explicit [Space Value](/models/decision-types/space-value) decision called "Space Unit" and a [Space Scale](/models/decision-types/space-scale#anchored) anchored on the value of the first one.

```json
[
    {
        "type": "space-value/explicit",
        "name": "Space Unit",
        "params": {
            "value": "8"
        }
    },
    {
        "type": "space-scale/anchored",
        "name": "Sizing Scale",
        "params": {
            "anchor": { "$name": "Space Unit" },
            "after": {
                "steps": 5,
                "modifier": { "mode": "gemetric", "by": 1.5 }
            }
        }
    }
]
```

You can also reference items of a decision set set or scale by adding the index to the reference.

In the following example we are creating a [Space Value](/models/decision-types/space-value) decision based on the second element of the "Sizing Scale" declared before.

```json
[
    {
        "type": "space-value/explicit",
        "name": "Default Size",
        "params": {
            "value": { "$name": "Sizing Scale", "index": 3 }
        }
    }
]
```
