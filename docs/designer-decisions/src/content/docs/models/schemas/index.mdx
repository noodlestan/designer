## About

Built-in schemas are auto-generated from the types in the source code.

-   [designer-decisions/src/types/decision-inputs/models](https://github.com/noodlestan/designer/tree/main/packages/libs/designer-decisions/src/types/decision-inputs/models)
-   [designer-decisions/src/types/decision-inputs/primitives](https://github.com/noodlestan/designer/tree/main/packages/libs/designer-decisions/src/types/decision-inputs/primitives)

Schemas are not checked-in in any repository. After they are generated they are published to NPM in the [@noodlestan/designer-schemas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noodlestan/designer-schemas?activeTab=code) package.
