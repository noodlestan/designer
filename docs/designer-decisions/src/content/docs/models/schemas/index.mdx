## About

Built-in schemas are auto-generated from the types in the source code.

-   [designer-decisions/src/types/decision-inputs/models](https://github.com/noodlestan/designer/tree/main/packages/libs/designer-decisions/src/types/decision-inputs/models)
-   [designer-decisions/src/types/decision-inputs/primitives](https://github.com/noodlestan/designer/tree/main/packages/libs/designer-decisions/src/types/decision-inputs/primitives)

Schemas are not checked-in in any repository. After they are generated they are published to NPM in the [@noodlestan/designer-schemas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noodlestan/designer-schemas?activeTab=code) package.

## Usage

The built-in schemas can be loaded by providing the `DECISION_SCHEMAS: SchemaSource` constant exported by [@noodlestan/designer-schemas](https://github.com/noodlestan/designer/blob/main/packages/libs/designer-schemas/src/constants.ts) to the [createDecisionLoader()](/api/designer-functions/Loader/createDecisionLoader) function.

```ts
import { createDecisionLoader } from '@noodlestan/designer-functions';
import { DECISION_SCHEMAS } from '@noodlestan/designer-schemas';

const loader = createDecisionLoader([DECISION_SCHEMAS], ...);
const store = await loader();
```

Refer to the [Loading and Validating](/guides/loading-and-validating-design-decisions/) guide for detailed instructions on how to setup a decision store.
