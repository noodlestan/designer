## About

Built-in schemas are auto-generated from the types in the source code.

-   [designer-decisions/src/types/decision-inputs/models](https://github.com/noodlestan/designer/tree/main/packages/libs/designer-decisions/src/types/decision-inputs/models)
-   [designer-decisions/src/types/decision-inputs/primitives](https://github.com/noodlestan/designer/tree/main/packages/libs/designer-decisions/src/types/decision-inputs/primitives)

Schemas are not checked-in in any repository. After they are generated they are published to NPM in the [@noodlestan/designer-schemas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noodlestan/designer-schemas?activeTab=code) package.

## Usage

The built-in schemas can be loaded by providing the `DECISION_SCHEMAS: SchemaSource` constant exported by [@noodlestan/designer-schemas](https://github.com/noodlestan/designer/blob/main/packages/libs/designer-schemas/src/constants.ts) to the [staticStoreBuilder()](/api/designer-functions/Builder/staticStoreBuilder) function.

```ts
import { DEMO_DATA } from '@noodlestan/designer-decisions';
import {
    type StoreOptions,
    createStoreContext,
    formatDecisionInputError,
    staticStoreBuilder,
} from '@noodlestan/designer-functions';
import { DECISION_SCHEMAS } from '@noodlestan/designer-schemas';

const options: StoreOptions = {
    decisions: [DEMO_DATA, './data'],
    schemas: [DECISION_SCHEMAS],
};
const context = createStoreContext(options);
const build = staticStoreBuilder(context);
const store = await build();
store.inputErrors().forEach(error => console.error(formatDecisionInputError(error)));
```
