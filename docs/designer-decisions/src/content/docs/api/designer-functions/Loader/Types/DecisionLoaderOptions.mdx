```ts
export type DecisionLoaderOptions = {
    schemas: SchemaSource[];
    decisions: (DecisionSource | string)[];
    resolver?: (moduleName: string) => Promise<string>;
};
```

## Attributes

#### ༶ `schemas`: [SchemaSource](/api/designer-decisions/Meta/Types/SchemaSource)[]

A list of schema configurations to load validation schemas from.

The definition for the built-in schema types can be imported from `@noodlestan/designer-schemas`.

```ts
import { DECISION_SCHEMAS } from '@noodlestan/designer-schemas';
```

#### ༶ `sources`: ([DecisionSource](/api/designer-decisions/Meta/Types/DecisionSource) | string)[]

A list of data sources to load decision data from.

Values of type `string` are treated as paths. Both relative paths (relative to the current working directory) and absolute paths are accepted.

Values of type [DecisionSource](/api/designer-decisions/Meta/Types/DecisionSource).

Designer Decisions sample data and demo data can be imported from `@noodlestan/designer-decisions`.

```ts
import { DEMO_DATA } from '@noodlestan/designer-decision';
```

#### ༶ `resolver`: (optional) (name: string) => Promise&lt;string&gt;

A function to resolve the physical location of packages containing decisions sources or schemas defined by [DecisionSource](/api/designer-decisions/Meta/Types/DecisionSource) and [SchemaSource](/api/designer-decisions/Meta/Types/SchemaSource) references of type `package`.

If one isn't provided, the default will be used. It uses [resolve()](https://github.com/browserify/resolve) under the hood and is able to locate the package in most scenarios, including complex monorepos.
