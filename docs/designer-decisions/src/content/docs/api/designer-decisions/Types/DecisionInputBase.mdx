Defines a decision input record.

## Attributes

##### à¼¶ `model: string`

The decision model identifier determines both:

-   the type of value produced by decision.
-   the decision model used to produce it, and the required input parameters

```json
   "model": "color-set/explicit"
```

All decision models named `color-set/*` produce a `Decision<ColorSet>` and expose the resolved
`ColorSet` value, which contains a set of `ColorValue`s, and - when declared - tokens and
token references.

The specific [color-set/anchored](/models/decision-types/color-set#anchored) decision model determines
how the color scale is generated. In this case, the model starts with an `anchor` color and
applies a `modifier` to create a number of color `steps` in either/both directions: `up` and `down`.

See [Reference: Decision Models](/models/decision-types) for the full list of decision types,
their resulting values and available models, and respective parameters.

##### à¼¶ `name: string` (non unique)

The decision name is mandatory.

```json
   "name": "Green Foreground"
```

The decision name can be used to create relationships between decisions.

```json
    "params": {
        "start": { "$name": "Green Foreground" }
    }
```

The same decision name can be declared more than once, as long as

-   the decision is scoped to different `contexts` each time.
-   the decision type is always the same

```json
[
    {
        "model": "color-value/explicit",
        "name": "Green Foreground",
        "params": { "value": "#090E0B" }
    },
    {
        "model": "color-value/explicit",
        "name": "Green Foreground",
        "contexts": ["Colour Scheme: Light Mode"],
        "params": { "value": "#F6FDF8" }
    }
]
```

##### à¼¶ `uuid: string` (optional) (unique)

When provided it can also be used to retrieve decision values and to create relationships
between decisions.

```json
   "uuid": "8c628648-f9e8-439a-aec2-b3b96ded3893"
```

By referencing the record's `uuid`, instead of the decision `name`, you can link
a decision to a specific record regardless of applicable context.

```json
    "params": {
        "value": { "$uuid": "8c628648-f9e8-439a-aec2-b3b96ded3893" }
    }
```

##### à¼¶ `description: string` (optional)

Provide a small description for the decision.

```json
    "decription": "Strongest shade of Green"
```

##### à¼¶ `usage: object` (optional)

These guidelines inform the intent of the decision, namely to _what_ they should be applied.

```json
    "usage": {
      "intendedFor": ["Icons", "Backgrounds"],
      "notFor": ["Typography"]
    }
```

##### à¼¶ `contexts: string[] | {all: string[], some?: string[]} ` (optional)

Contexts inform _where_, _when_ or _to whom_ a certain design decision is applicable.

The decision value will exist only when at least one of these contexts is present.

```json
    "contexts": ["Email", "Support"]
```

Alternatively, a list of required contexts can be provided via an object:

-   `all: string[]` - The decision will only be in effect when all these contexts are present.

```json
    "contexts": {
      "all": ["Email", "Support"]
    }
```

-   `some?: string[]` - When provided, at least one of these contexts must also be present.

```json
    "contexts": {
      "all": ["Email", "Support"],
      "some": ["Headers", "Footers"]
    }
```

##### à¼¶ `params: object` (optional)

The shape of the parameters of each each decision is driven by the decision model.

As an example, the [color-set/anchored](/models/decision-types/color-set#anchored) decision model
requires as input:

-   a starting color (here provided as a reference to another decision)
-   a modifier object with `SignedPercentage` values for
    -   `h` - Hue
    -   `s` - Saturation
    -   `l` - Lightness
-   a number that specifies the total number of steps of the set

```json
    "model": "color-set/anchored"
    "params": {
        "anchor": { "$name": "Green Foreground" },
        "after": {
            "steps": 5,
            "modifier": {
                "l": { "mode": "linear", "by": 5 }
            }
        }
    }
```

In turn, the [color-set/explicit](/models/decision-types/color-set#explicit) decision model,
requires only a single parameter: the explicit list of colors (or references) in the set.

```json
    "model": "color-set/explicit",
    "params": {
        "values": ["#312506", "#564109", "#7D5E0A", "#A57B0A"]
    }
```

As another example, the [color-value/explicit](/models/decision-types/color-value#explicit)

The color value can be specified in a number of formats, according to the ðŸš§ schema.

```json
    "model": "color-value/explicit",
    "params": {
        "value": { "h": 144, "s": 0.22, "l": 0.05 }
    }
```

As well as a decision reference.

```json
    "model": "color-value/explicit",
    "params": {
        "value": { "$name": "Green Foreground" }
    }
```

See [Decision Models Reference](/models/decision-types) for each model's input parameter.
