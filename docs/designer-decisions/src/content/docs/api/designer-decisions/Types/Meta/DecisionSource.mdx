```ts
export type DecisionSource = {
    name: string;
    source: DataSource;
};
```

### Attributes

### ༶ `name: string`

The name of the decision source is carried over to the decision store and emitted along with validation errors so that authors can easily pinpoint issues.

### ༶ `source`: [DataSource](/api/designer-decisions/Types/Meta/DataSource)

The data source definition.

## Usage

If your data is going to be consumed in different packages you are encourage to export a constant from the package where the data resides so that consumers can easily configure loaders an processors.

The [demo data](https://github.com/noodlestan/designer/blob/main/packages/libs/designer-decisions/src/meta/data/constants.ts) in `@noodlestan/designer-decisions` is exposed like this:

```ts
const DEMO_DATA: DecisionSource = {
    name: 'Designer Decisions Demo Data',
    source: {
        type: 'package',
        package: '@noodlestan/designer-decisions',
        path: 'resources/data/demo',
    },
};
```

Both the [minimal boilerplate](https://github.com/noodlestan/designer-boilerplate-minimal/blob/main/scripts/build-decisions.js) and the [Astro boilerplate](https://github.com/noodlestan/designer-boilerplate-astro/blob/main/scripts/validate-decisions.js) import this constant to configure the [createDecisionLoader()](/api/designer-functions/Loader/createDecisionLoader).
