```ts
export type SchemaSource = {
    name: string;
    source: DataSource;
};
```

### Attributes

### ༶ `name: string`

The name of the schema source is emitted along with any errors that occur while setting up the validator so that schema authors and consumers can easily pinpoint issues.

### ༶ `source`: [DataSource](/api/designer-decisions/Types/Meta/DataSource)

The data source definition.

## Usage

If your schemas are going to be consumed in different packages you are encourage to export a constant from the package where the schemas reside so that consumers can easily configure loaders an processors.

Designer Decisions [built-in schemas](https://github.com/noodlestan/designer/blob/main/packages/libs/designer-schemas/src/constants.ts) in `@noodlestan/designer-schemas` are exposed this way.

```ts
const DECISION_SCHEMAS: SchemaSource = {
    urnBase: 'urn:designer',
    source: {
        type: 'package',
        package: '@noodlestan/designer-schemas',
        path: 'schemas/',
    },
};
```

Both the [minimal boilerplate](https://github.com/noodlestan/designer-boilerplate-minimal/blob/main/scripts/build-decisions.js) and the [Astro boilerplate](https://github.com/noodlestan/designer-boilerplate-astro/blob/main/scripts/validate-decisions.js) import this constant to configure the [createDecisionLoader()](/api/designer-functions/Loader/createDecisionLoader).
