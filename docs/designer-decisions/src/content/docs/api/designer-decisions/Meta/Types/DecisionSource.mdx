```ts
export type DecisionSource = {
    name: string;
    source: DataSource;
};
```

## Attributes

### ༶ `name`: string

The name of the decision source is carried over to the decision store and emitted along with validation errors so that authors can easily pinpoint issues.

### ༶ `source`: [DataSource](/api/designer-decisions/Meta/Types/DataSource)

The data source definition.

### ༶ `schemas`: (optional) [SchemaSource](/api/designer-decisions/Meta/Types/SchemaSource)

A list of schemas definitions that the decision source relies on.

It is recommended to list all schemas explicitly, including the built-in ones, to make sure that they are loaded even when configuration in the target system does not reference them.

## Usage

If your data is going to be consumed in different packages you are encourage to export a constant from the package where the data resides so that consumers can easily configure loaders an processors.

The [demo data](https://github.com/noodlestan/designer/blob/main/packages/libs/designer-decisions/src/meta/data/constants.ts) in `@noodlestan/designer-decisions` is exposed like this:

```ts
import { DECISION_SCHEMAS } from '@noodlestan/designer-schemas';

const DEMO_DATA: DecisionSource = {
    name: 'Designer Decisions Demo Data',
    source: {
        type: 'package',
        package: '@noodlestan/designer-decisions',
        path: 'resources/data/demo',
    },
    schemas: [DECISION_SCHEMAS],
};
```

Both the [minimal boilerplate](https://github.com/noodlestan/designer-boilerplate-minimal/blob/main/dd.config.mjs) and the [Astro boilerplate](https://github.com/noodlestan/designer-boilerplate-astro/blob/main/dd.config.mjs) import this constant to build and validate options for the [buildStaticStore()](/api/designer-functions/Builder/buildStaticStore) function.
