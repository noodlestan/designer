The `DataSource` data structure defines how to load [schemas](/api/designer-decisions/Meta/Types/SchemaSource) and [decisions](/api/designer-decisions/Meta/Types/DecisionSource).

```ts
export type DataSourcePackage = { type: 'package'; package: string; path: string };

export type DataSourcePath = { type: 'path'; path: string };

export type DataSource = DataSourcePackage | DataSourcePath;
```

## Data Source Types

Currently, only file system based data source types are supported, but [our plans](https://github.com/orgs/noodlestan/projects/3) include the ability to fetch data from remote locations as well.

### `DataSourcePath`

Defines a relative or absolute path in the filesystem.

**Example:**

```ts
const data: DataSource = { type: 'path', path: './data' };
```

The [minimal boilerplate](https://github.com/noodlestan/designer-boilerplate-minimal/blob/main/dd.config.mjs) uses this format to declare the local data.

#### ༶ `type: "path"`

#### ༶ `path: string`

Either relative to the current working directory or absolute in the filesystem.

### `DataSourcePackage`

Defines a path relative to the root of a specific package.

**Example:**

```ts
const data = { type: 'package', package: '@noodlestan/designer-schemas', path: './schemas' };
```

Both the [demo data](https://github.com/noodlestan/designer/blob/main/packages/libs/designer-decisions/src/meta/data/constants.ts) in `@noodlestan/designer-decisions` and the [schemas](https://github.com/noodlestan/designer/blob/main/packages/libs/designer-schemas/src/constants.ts) in `@noodlestan/designer-decisions` are exposed this way.

<Aside type="tip">
    As long as the package name can be resolved to a path in the filesystem the decision store
    builder will be able to locate the data files. Regardless, it is advisable to list the
    dependency explicitly in the project's `package.json`.
</Aside>

#### ༶ `type`: "package"

#### ༶ `name`: string

The name of the package as declared in its `package.json`.

#### ༶ `path`: string

The path within the package.
