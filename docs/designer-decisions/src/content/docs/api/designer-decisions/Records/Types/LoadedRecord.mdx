Describes a record loaded from a [DecisionSource](/api/designer-decisions/Meta/Types/DecisionSource).

```ts
export type LoadedRecord = {
    input: DeepPartial<DecisionInput>;
    source: DecisionSource;
    file?: string;
    uuid?: string;
};
```

The `input` is eventually invalid and may not match the [DecisionInput](/api/designer-decisions/Inputs/Types/DecisionInput) shape.
