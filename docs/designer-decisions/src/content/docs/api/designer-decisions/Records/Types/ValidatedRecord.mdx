Describes a validated `DecisionInput` with eventual [RecordError](/api/designer-decisions/Records/Types/RecordError).

```ts
export type ValidatedRecord = LoadedRecord & {
    uuid: string;
    loaded: LoadedRecord['input'];
    input: DecisionInput;
    errors: RecordError[];
};
```

Extends [LoadedRecord](/api/designer-decisions/Records/Types/LoadedRecord).

Adds a unique `uuid` (one is generated is if not provided in the `input` object).

In case of validation errors, overrides the `input` attribute with normalized data to make sure it matches the shape [DecisionInput](/api/designer-decisions/Inputs/Types/DecisionInput) shape.

The original input, eventually invalid, is available as `loaded`.
